	/*The program shall generate random numbers with a SecureRandom object
	 * The program shall ask the student to enter a difficulty level of 1, 2, 3, or 4

	 * A difficulty level of 2 shall limit random numbers to the range of 0-99, inclusive
	 * A difficulty level of 3 shall limit random numbers to the range of 0-999, inclusive
	 * A difficulty level of 4 shall limit random numbers to the range of 0-9999, inclusive
	 * The program shall ask the student to enter a problem type of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 with an appropriate human-readable label
	 * The program shall ask the student to solve 10 different problems, as determined by the problem type
	 * A problem type of 1 shall limit the program to generating only addition problems
	 * A problem type of 2 shall limit the program to generating only multiplication problems
	 * A problem type of 3 shall limit the program to generating only subtraction problems
	 * A problem type of 4 shall limit the program to generating only division problems
	 * A problem type of 5 shall result questions that are a randomly mixture of addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division problems
	 * Problems shall contain two numbers sampled from a uniform random distribution with bounds determined by the problem difficulty
	 * The program shall display a random positive message if the student provides a correct response
	 * The program shall display a random negative message if the student provides an incorrect response
	 * The program shall display the student's score after the student has attempted to solve 10 problems
	 * The student's score shall be the percentage of problems correctly solved
	 * The program shall display the message "Please ask your teacher for extra help." if the student's score is less than 75%
	 * The program shall display the message "Congratulations, you are ready to go to the next level!" if the student's score is greater than or equal to 75%
	 * The program shall ask the student if they want to solve a new problem set after the score message has been displayed
	 * The program shall restart when the student agrees to solve a new problem set
	 * The program shall terminate when the student declines to solve another problem set
	 * Create a method called "quiz" that contains the program logic
	 * Create a method called "readDifficulty" that reads the difficulty level from the student
	 * Create a method called "readProblemType" that reads the difficulty level from the student
	 * Create a method called "generateQuestionArgument" that uses the difficulty level to generate a random number
	 * Create a method called "askQuestion" that prints the problem to the screen
	 * Create a method called "readResponse" that reads the answer from the student
	 * Create a method called "isAnswerCorrect" that checks to see if the student's answer matches the correct answer to the problem
	 * Create a method called "displayCorrectResponse" that prints out the response when a student enters a correct answer
	 * Create a method called "displayIncorrectResponse" that prints out the response when a student enters an incorrect answer
	 * Create a method called "displayCompletionMessage" that prints out the studen't score and appropriate score response
